12/05/2011  New arguments to allow user to specify rotation
               The "rotangle=" and "rottol=" arguments allow user
                   to specify an allowed range of rotation angles
                   between the two sets of coordinates

11/30/2010  Added Unix-style man page, "install" target

6/26/2010   Very minor changes
                Now print elements of TRANS as %15.9e instead of %15.9f
                   should increase accuracy when elements have small values
                Added information in debug printf in "atpmatch.c"
                   now print the ratio of triangle scales when a match is found
                
6/11/2008   Bug fix in "apply_match.c"
                added extra %s in sscanf statement

10/25/2003  Small change to "project_coords" program:
                new option "asec" prints (xi, eta) in arcsec, not radians

5/19/2003   Small fix to "apply_match" program:
                now handle coordinates near celestial poles properly

10/23/2002  Small bug fixes to avoid assertion failures: 
                match.c and atpmatch.c

6/19/2002   Enhancements, code supplied by John Blakeslee:
                new routine, atCalcRMS, calculates "sx" and "sy" for
                all matching items in each direction, using 1 iteration
                of 3-sigma clipping

12/31/2001  More enhancements, suggested by John Blakeslee:
                a. identity [xsh=] [ysh=] option
                b. intrans= option, so user can specify exactly the
                     expected TRANS
            Several small bug fixes, thanks to John and Andrew Bennett.

12/14/2001  A number of enhancements, suggested by John Blakeslee.
            Also fixed a bug in handling the "id" columns.

6/28/2001   Fixed minor bug in "project_coords.c", around line 300.
            The "sscanf" call used to read in data had only 10 %s
				in the format string; it should have had 20 of them.
				It caused the program to discard any data after the
				10'th column in the input file.
